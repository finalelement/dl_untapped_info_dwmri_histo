This is the official code repository for the work titled:
Deep learning reveals untapped information for local white-matter fiber reconstruction in diffusion-weighted MRI 

The repository contains the model weights and a python script reconstruct the model before loading weights.
Code for Spherical Harmonics will be uploaded soon, in the meanwhile please feel free to use DiPy for SH reconstruction.

#####Work in Progress#####
